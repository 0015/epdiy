9.7" epaper breakout (Kindle DX screen)
=======================================

I always wanted a large, affordable E-Ink screen to play around with. The result is a board to talk to a Kindle DX screen with an ESP32.

A breakout board for the ED097OC4 9.7" ePaper (or E-Ink) display. ePaper is a fascinating technology for low-power and pleasant-to-look-at screens. However, ready-made DIY modules for this size and with 4bpp (16 Grayscale) color support are currently quite expensive.

This project uses Kindle DX replacement screens, which are available for 30$ on ebay, making tinkering with those screens much more affordable.
